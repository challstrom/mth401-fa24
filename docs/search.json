You do not need to let me know you’re coming – just stop by my office (BC 270). Many students find these drop-in hours can be particularly helpful if you are working together with classmates. You can work together at one of the tables down the hall from my office and just pop in when you have questions.",

Or you might simply find it more convenient to meet with me at a different time. If you go to my Calendly scheduler, you can sign-up for a time slot to meet, either in-person or via zoom. If there is a specific time that works for you and you don’t see it available on the Calendly scheduler, please reach out to me via email and we will find a time that works for your schedule.",
