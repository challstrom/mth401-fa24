    "text": "Welcome!\nBefore we get into the details of the course, I want to share with you a few thoughts about my general approach to teaching and learning. My main goal as the professor in this course is to help you succeed in not just learning the material but in growing as a learner. Learning takes effort, a willingness to try something that may not work, and the ability to use feedback to refine your understanding. My job is to foster an environment in which each and every one of you are supported in these aspects.\nMuch of the work for this course will be done within class or small group discussions for which we will rely on everyone in this class as a source for feedback and support. Because of this, it’s important that we create an inclusive community that is respectful of our differences and offers space for the boundary-setting necessary for positive relationships to form. Our diversity is reflected by differences in race, gender, sexuality, ability, class, religion, nationality, and other cultural identities and material circumstances.\nI am looking forward to getting to know each of you and it is my sincere goal to make our time together (in class and out) productive and engaging. I want you to feel comfortable coming to me with any questions or concerns that arise, mathematical and otherwise. If you encounter any issues that interfere with your learning, whether they are physical, mental, emotional, economic, or otherwise, or if you experience discrimination or mistreatment of any sort, please contact me immediately. Other resources for support include the Chair of the Math Department or the CAS Dean of Students.",

    "text": "We will use a method of instruction often called Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) which is designed to engage and foster skills and habits that working mathematicians use regularly; you will be asked to solve problems, make conjectures, experiment, explore, create, collaborate, and communicate your work with your peers. Rather than giving you facts to memorize or showing you clear paths to solutions, my role is to guide you via a sequence of carefully chosen problems through a journey of mathematical discovery.\nThroughout the semester, you will receive lists of definitions to interpret and make sense of, as well as exercises and theorems which you and your classmates will answer or prove. There will be very little traditional lecture. Instead, class time will consist of student presentations of new material. For best results, you should come to class prepared to share your work or ideas about that day’s problems. This method of inquiry does not work nearly as well if you’re looking at a problem for the first time in-class.\nYou will be asked to share your solutions in class regularly. You will also be encouraged to critique the problems (reformulating them if needed), to generate examples and counterexamples to theorems or conjectures, to conjecture new theorems based on what you’ve learned, and to prove or disprove these conjectures. When observing another student’s presentation, it is your responsibility to follow their argument closely and decide if they have seems reasonable. If you cannot follow their logic, or have questions about their solution, it is your responsibility to ask!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA key feature of the IBL method is student discovery and therefore outside resources are not allowed. This means that you should not consult texts (other than the one handed out in class), the internet, students not currently enrolled in the course, or faculty other than myself. Consulting outside resources will only deprive yourself of opportunities to engage with the material authentically.\nYou are encouraged to work with your classmates on the problems, but for best results you should get as far as you can on your own before collaborating. It’s important that you do not feel overwhelmed – so please let me know if you’re stuck on a problem and I’ll be happy to give you hints.",

Here is an incomplete set of guidelines you may find helpful:\n\nWork is clearly written using complete sentences. In particular, all mathematical notation and expressions are part of a sentence.\nWriting should be neat and legible. If your handwriting is not up to the task, you should consider using a typesetting enviornment such as \\(\\LaTeX\\)\nIt should probably contain more words than symbols.\nIt is written at a level that is appropriate for a MTH 401 audience, namely, members of our class who are familiar with the content of the course but who may not have worked on the particular problem whose solution you are presenting.\nThe proof is complete, meaning that a member of our MTH 401 audience (see above) can trace your reasoning from beginning to end and be persuaded that your proof is correct without having to reconstruct or guess at significant portions of your thinking.\nThe proposition or claim to be proven is clearly stated as such.\nThe proof is correct and the steps in the proof are also correct.\nYour writing is almost free, if not entirely free, of spelling errors.\nYour writing is almost free, if not entirely free, of basic grammatical errors such as incomplete sentences, subject-verb disagreement, and misuse of punctuation.",

Such pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.\nEspecially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at libguides.up.edu/cite.\nThe misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not detract from the established learning outcomes of the course.
